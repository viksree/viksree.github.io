<p>As I've told people over the past few months that I'm planning on going to grad
school in the fall, I've gotten a number of quizzical looks: "Do you want to be
a professor? Go get your Ph.D. If not, it's a waste of time. Go
get a job, and you'll be ready to start a company in a few years." I've heard
the same thing from a ton people -- software engineers in the Valley, VCs, and
even former Ph.D.s who are now in industry. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/sreekanti">my
dad</a>, who'd been telling me that I should go to
grad school for as long as I can remember has said that he's not sure if it's
worth it.</p>

<p>That said, I'm starting my Ph.D. at Berkeley this coming fall, and I couldn't be 
more excited. I’m writing this to talk about why I’m excited despite other
peoples’ misgivings.</p>

<h1>What people have told me...</h1>

<p>I've spent the last month or so talking to grad students and professors at
visit days. From what I've gathered, success &amp; fulfillment in grad school are
the combination of three things. First (in order of the things I've been told
the most emphatically) is a good relationship with your advisor. I've had the
phenomenal opportunity to work with <a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh">my advisor</a>
for the past year, and I'm confident that our research interests align well and
that we work well together.</p>

<p>The second thing that's come up a lot is your motivation for going grad school.
From what I've been told, going to grad school without being excited about 
doing research and exploring a new (sub-sub-)field often proves to be a recipe
for disaster. My motivation for going to grad school is to build interesting &amp;
ground-breaking systems. I hope that, by definition, that means that I'll be
exploring a new space in computer science. <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The last thing that I've heard is that it's important to pick the right group
with the right set of research interests. I can honestly say that every project
in the <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/DBMS/">Berkeley database
group</a> is something that
I'd be interested in working on and that's incredibly reassuring for me. I also
think that the <a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu">DB group</a> here has some of the
smartest and coolest people that I've met, and I'm excited to be able to pick
their brains for the next few years.</p>

<h1>Other Things I'm excited about</h1>

<p>In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cutting-edge research</strong>: Recently, at <a href="http://cs.cmu.edu">CMU</a>'s grad visit day,
in a conversation with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/">Peter Steenkiste</a>, we
happened upon the topic of Ph.D.s oriented towards academia as opposed to
those oriented towards industry and industrial research labs. His point
(paraphrased, of course) was that whether you go into industry, academia,
or something else, getting a Ph.D.  trains you to pick out interesting
problems and to become a leader in your field by solving or attempting to
solve those problems. Of course, those are skills you can get elsewhere and
can cultivate with sufficient exposure and effort. But to me, it seems
immensely valuable to be in a place where the goal is to learn how to
become a good researcher and how to find and solve cutting-edge problems.</li>

<li><strong>Berkeley's open-source tradition</strong>: Some of the most influential
open source projects, both historically (Ingres, Postgres, BSD) and in the
last few years (Mesos, Spark, Jupyter Notebooks) have come out of Berkeley.
I'd love to be able to contribute to that. (A lofty goal, I know.)</li>

<li><strong>My current work</strong>: For the past year, I've been working on a project called
<a href="http://www.ground-metadata.org">Ground</a> (see our <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/vikrams/grounding-big-data">most recent Strata
talk</a>). There's a ton of
really awesome work that we're hoping to do and a really interesting system
that we need to finish building. I'm really excited to see where the future of
this work leads us.</li>

<li><strong>Having access to Silicon Valley</strong>: I'm really passionate about doing research
that people somehow benefit from. Being in the backyard of the Silicon Valley
is great for fostering collaboration with a bunch of awesome people working on
cool stuff and to translate that into meaningful &amp; impactful research. That's
not to say that this isn't possible at other schools; it's just something I
know Berkeley does, and it's awesome.</li>
</ul>

<p>The funny part of all of this is that I had absolutely no interest in going to
grad school until my final year of college. I happened to take a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cs286fall2014/">seminar on
databases</a> and remember thinking
to myself, "There's all this innovative, valuable software built in academia.
Why didn't I consider it before?" What really drew me in though was
understanding that there are many pieces of software that are technically
challenging and valuable to tons of users that can't be monetized in any way.
For me, that's really important: I want to build things that I know people are
going to use and will find valuable. In academia, I don't have to worry about
whether or not there's a business model that suits that software. For the kind
of databases &amp; systems research that I'm interested in, the focus is on
building something well, making sure that it has value, and making sure that
it's cutting-edge.a</p>

<p>That's why I'm looking forward to grad school. I'm looking forward to spending
the next few years learning from some of the smartest people in the world at
Berkeley, working on interesting and useful problems, and learning how to be a
better researcher. I'm very much looking forward to learning how to pick &amp;
scope an interesting problem and how to present my ideas well. Most importantly
for me, I'm excited to learn from the thought leaders in my field.</p>
